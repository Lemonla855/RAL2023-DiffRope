# Getting Started

### PyElastica Overview
We have written a introductory guide to using PyElastica available on the project website [here](https://cosseratrods.org/software/pyelastica/#pyelastica-workflow)

### Tutorials
We have created several Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts to help get users started with using PyElastica. The Jupyter notebooks are available on Binder, allowing you to try out some of the tutorials without having to install PyElastica.

Additional examples are also available in the examples folder of PyElastica's [Github repo](https://github.com/GazzolaLab/PyElastica).

### Visualization
If you wish to visualize your system, you can either plot your data using a python package such as `matplotlib`, or any rendering software that you choose. Note, many of the visualization scripts in the examples folders require [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) (be sure to install with h264 libraries).

For high-quality visualization, we suggest [POVray](http://povray.com). See [this tutorial](https://github.com/GazzolaLab/PyElastica/tree/master/examples/Visualization) for examples of different ways of visualizing the system.
